Recorded offences include any criminal act or omission by a person or organisation for which a penalty could be imposed by the Victorian legal system.

Recorded offence data are compiled on the basis of the date that the offence was created on the LEAP database, rather than the date the offence was detected by, or reported to police. The create date may not be the date when the offence occurred, or the date when the offence came to the attention of police.\n<br/>\nThe crime statistics are aggregated to Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) Local Government Area (LGA) 2011 boundaries (1259.0.30.001). <br/>\nPlease note, in order to maintain confidentiality, sensitive offence counts for subdivisions Homicide and related offences and  Sexual offences with a value of 3 or less are given a value of 2 to calculate totals.
